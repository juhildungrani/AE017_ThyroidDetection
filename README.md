Automated thyroid nodule detection from ultrasound imaging using deep convolutional neural networks 
• Computer aided detection of thyroid nodules is an essential step for diagnosis.  
• The proposed deep learning nodule detection framework is based on multi-task model named Mask R-CNN. 
• A regularized loss function is applied to prioritize detection task over segmentation task.
• The proposed model is able to detect various types of thyroid nodules in noisy ultrasound scans.
• Proposed Mask R-CNN variant outperforms two previous state-of-the-art nodule detection methods.
